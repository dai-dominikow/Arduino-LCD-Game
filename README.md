# Arduino-LCD-Game
My first video game ever!.

I made this based on my dog Mileva. She does not get along with cats :B

For this videogame I used Arduino Uno, LCD 16x2 I2C, one button, one 1K Ohm Resistor and a bunch of cables.

The sprites were created with https://tusindfryd.github.io/screenduino/

A video of me playing is in this repository, hope you like it!
